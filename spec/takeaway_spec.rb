# Task 2

# Write a class Takeaway.
# Implement the following functionality:
# - list of dishes with prices
# - placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. 
# 	If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, 
# 	otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, 
# 	e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
# - The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
# - Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
# - Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
# - Make sure that your Takeaway class is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send 
# 	texts when your tests are run
# - However, if your Takeaway class is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
# - A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, 
# don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
